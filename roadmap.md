# Roadmap

Here are some of the features that I am working on or planning to implement in future versions.

- [ ] Add headers and footers for `ImplicitlyAnimatedReorderableList`.

### Added in 0.1.4

- [x] Add horizontal scrollDirection support for `ImplicitlyAnimatedReorderableList`.
- [x] Make `Handle` scroll aware to only initiate a drag when the scroll position didn't change.
